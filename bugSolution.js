The solution typically involves double-checking the installation and linking process of the native modules involved. This often requires ensuring that the necessary native dependencies are properly installed within the native project folders (i.e., the iOS and Android folders within your Expo project).  The exact steps might vary based on the specific library and how Expo handles the linking process.  Often a clean build (`expo prebuild --clean` followed by `expo start`) after verifying the installations helps to resolve the errors.  Check library documentation for platform-specific instructions.

In some cases, updating Expo and the problematic libraries to their latest versions will resolve compatibility issues.  Sometimes, removing and reinstalling the specific native modules can resolve the linking problem.  If that fails, manually reinstalling the native module within the specific platform's folder is often the final step.  Make sure to rebuild and restart the app after each step.
