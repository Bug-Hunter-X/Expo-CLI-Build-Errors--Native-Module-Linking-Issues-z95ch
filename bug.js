This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and attempting to run an application that requires certain native modules or dependencies which are not properly configured or installed. This is often seen when working with libraries that require native code integration, such as those involving camera access, geolocation, or platform-specific functionalities.  The error message itself might not be very specific, but it typically points to an underlying issue with the build process failing to link the native modules correctly.  
Example Scenario:  You are using a library `react-native-camera` and you get an error during the build or runtime that mentions issues in the native modules or linking errors.
